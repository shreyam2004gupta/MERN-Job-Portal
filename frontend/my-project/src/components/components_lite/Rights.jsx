      <h1>Copyright Notices</h1>

      <p>
        You see them everywhere from TV shows, to books, to movies, to song
        lyrics. Virtually any time you're dealing with something that someone
        else created, you're going to see a copyright notice.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you want to protect your rights -- or make sure that you don't
        violate anyone else's rights -- you need to know exactly how copyright
        notices work.
      </p>

      <h2>What Is a Copyright?</h2>

      <p>
        First and foremost, what exactly is a copyright? In the US, a copyright
        is a right that dates all the way back to the Constitution.
        Specifically, in Article I, Section 8, Clause 8, Congress is given the
        power to "promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing
        for limited time to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their
        respective writings and discoveries."
      </p>

      <p>
        In other words, the author of a work gets to exclusively sell his work
        for a limited time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Copyright protection has been bolstered by the federal laws that have
        been created since. Now, copyright owners get to decide exactly how
        their works are used and distributed. Copyright laws are designed to
        protect the original author of intellectual property -- like art,
        poetry, songs, movies, and even computer software.
      </p>

      <p>
        Contrary to popular belief, things like inventions, designs for a
        specific product, and company slogans do not fall under copyright
        protection. Instead, those things are protected by patents and
        trademarks.
      </p>

      <h2>Registering Your Copyright</h2>

      <p>
        You're not required to formally register your copyright whenever you
        create new intellectual property. Your rights as the owner automatically
        go into effect the moment your intellectual property is created, even if
        you haven't published it yet.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, if you do want to formally register with the US Copyright
        Office you'll have to fill out a quick form, pay a one-time fee, and
        provide a deposit of the work being registered. You'll get a certificate
        that lists several details, including:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The title of the copyrighted work</li>
        <li>The author of the work</li>
        <li>The name and address of the official copyright owner</li>
        <li>The year the work was created</li>
        <li>
          Some status information about the work, such as if it contains
          information that previously registered, or if the work is unpublished
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Joint Works and Collaborative Copyrights</h2>

      <p>
        But what if you and a friend write a book together? Who gets the
        copyright protection?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Both of you.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        The two of you are considered joint authors under US law, so you would
        both have full copyright protection for the entire book.
      </p>

      <p>
        Or, if you and a group of people each write one chapter to create a big
        book, you'll each have copyright protection for the individual chapter
        that you wrote.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fortunately, the US has copyright relations with dozens of different
        countries. As a result, you'll have full copyright protection in any of
        these countries no matter how many people may have collaborated on the
        work.
